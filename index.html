            <h2>WHO I am:</h2>
            <p>A software engineering lead candidate skilled in planning and leading development in new products or enhancements,
                writing and reviewing clean, testable UI code, and determining the appropriate scope and timeline for deliverables.
                Experienced with Scala, Java, C++, VB, React, jQuery, Node, vanilla JavaScript, and mobile-first responsive development with HTML5 and CSS3.
                Versed in modern tooling and excited to pick up the right tools for the job.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Yes, I do have two names! I am bigender, a subset of non-binary. I use Jem (she/her) when presenting female and Jason (he/him) when presenting male.
                Don't worry about which to use when contacting me, if you can't see me I don't expect you to know my gender! In synchornous communication I may say "It's Jem today"
                or "It's Jason today" to make things easier. I also generally update my slack handle to make it simpler for people talking to me that day.
                If I'm not around, I don't care, but if you would like a rule of thumb, just use which ever name and pronouns I was using when you last spoke to me.  </p>
